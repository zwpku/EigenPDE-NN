# EigenPDE-solver-NN
An Eigenvalue PDE Solver by Neural Networks

## Preparation
#### 1. Dependances (optional)

- [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/) is used to load MD data. It is not needed if the training data is generated by sampling SDE (i.e. when the parameter namd_data_flag=False in [params.cfg](working_dir/params.cfg). 

- [slepc4py](https://pypi.org/project/slepc4py/) and [petsc4py](https://pypi.org/project/petsc4py/) are used in solving 2D eigenvalue PDE problems using finite volume method. In some examples, the solution given by finite volume method can be used to compare with the solution obtained from training neural networks. 
These two packages are **not** needed if one only wants to solve a PDE problem by training neural networks.

#### 2. Download the code 

```
	git clone https://github.com/zwpku/EigenPDE-solver-NN.git
```

## Usage

#### 1. Enter the directory containing source codes and create a clean working directory.

```
  	cd ./EigenPDE-solver-NN
	cp -r working_dir working_dir_task1
	cd ./working_dir_task1
```

#### 2. View and modify the parameters in the configure file [params.cfg](working_dir/params.cfg).

#### 3. Run the script [main.py](working_dir/main.py), and choose a task from input.

```
   ./main.py
```
